    "## Initial Brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Direction:  \n",
    "  Exploring a companion robot designed to improve emotional connection and communication for international students and long-distance families/couples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pain Points Identified:\n",
    "  - Difficulty in maintaining meaningful communication across countries and time zones.  \n",
    "  - Lack of emotional presence in current tools (text, video calls), user need for more natural, playful, and ritualized interaction.  \n",
    "  - Many seniors and children struggle to adapt to new technologies like smartphones and FaceTime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Products: \n",
    "  We came across the [ROLA Mini Companion Robot](https://www.enabot.com/products/rola-mini-companion-robot), which already addresses companionship but lacks strong differentiation and marketing appeal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea Variants: \n",
    "  - Idea A: Adaptation of ROLA Mini with improved emotional interaction features (e.g., light, sound, motion).  \n",
    "  - Idea B: Long-distance ritual companion robot emphasizing shared routines (morning greetings, meals, etc).  \n",
    "  - Idea C: Companion robot tailored for elderly parents and small childrens (simplified UI + physical button for check-ins).  \n",
    "  - Idea D: Pet monitoring robot introduces playful interactions (treat delivery, light-based games) to engage pets rather than just watch them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection:  \n",
    "  From the beginning, my group member and I discussed the overall direction of our product. Since we are both international students, we share the common challenge of maintaining meaningful communication with our families in another country. Building on this pain point, I proposed an idea inspired by a social media reel: in the reel, a person in a long-distance relationship interacts with her partner through a small robot that he remotely controls, such as pushing a tray of jam toward her while engaging in playful conversations.  \n",
    "  After exploring similar existing products, we found [ROLA Mini](https://www.enabot.com/products/rola-mini-companion-robot) and decided to use it as a reference point to identify how it could be improved—both functionally and in terms of marketing value.  \n",

    "### Raw Output \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt: **Give me the target user profile of social robots like ROLA Mini Companion Robot**\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT:This social robot is designed for users who value emotional presence and ritualized companionship as much as functional utility. Core segments include young urban professionals seeking light support after work, elderly adults who may experience loneliness or mobility challenges, and families or couples maintaining long-distance relationships. They tend to adopt smart tech early, engage with the robot in short daily interactions, and are willing to pay for services that add social or emotional value. In essence, the ideal user is emotionally open, routine-oriented, and looks for a low-friction way to feel less alone.\n",

    "ChatGPT: In essence, the core pain point is: “I want to feel connected and cared for, but current digital tools make connection feel effortful, shallow, or cold.” Users hesitate to adopt “cameras/mics” unless they trust the brand to protect them. And they need for “human-like” companionship in a non-intrusive form.\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful or generic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, almost every response contains something valuable. I begin with the target audience because we cannot design truly useful and feasible features without first understanding users’ pain points. Later, we will refine this in the [marketing section](#marketing-communication-with-ai). I also noticed that when the system is not guided to act as a product innovation consultant, its suggestions tend to be generic and require further refinement. However, once we add constraints to the response format, the functions become more practical, innovative, and aligned with real marketing potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "From the generated ideas, I identified five key features that balance strong marketing potential with meaningful technical improvements. These selected features represent both differentiation in the market and feasibility for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mood Mirror:** Moves beyond surveillance by offering empathetic feedback — the robot detects tone, posture, or context, and reflects back mood through lights or short affirmations (e.g., “You sound tired, take a break”), potentially combined with AI for more nuanced, personalized responses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shared Rhythm:** Two linked robots, may paired with a wearable bracelets, can sync gentle pulses or breathing-like rhythms across distance, creating an intimate sense of presence far beyond text or video while also opening opportunities for bundled accessory sales.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Companion Choreography:** The robot performs simple, expressive motions such as nodding, tilting, or light dances that respond to music or user emotion, adding personality absent in static smart speakers while avoiding the complexity and bulk of humanoid robots, though careful design is needed to ensure safe and meaningful movement patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scent Cue Pod (Optional Add-On):** Multi-sensory connection is introduced through scent cartridges that trigger during greetings or rituals, enriching the user experience and enabling consumable upsell or bundled sets, though users will need to manage replacing or refilling the pods themselves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-Tap Check-In:** Aimed at elderly users and children, this feature allows a simple button press to notify family members, reducing the learning curve by removing the need for complex instructions while reinforcing trust and ease of use.  \n",
